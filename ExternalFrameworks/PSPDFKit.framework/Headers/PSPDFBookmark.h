 The ProviderSupport category gives you access to some internal properties that

 in a database.

 If possible, use the `NSCoding` support provided by `PSPDFBookmark` so store and
 read bookmarks as in this case the bookmark ensures to properly store all internal
 states and migrate old versions of it automatically.

 If this is not possible, the methods in this category provide you with some properties
 that need to be stored together with the other informations to properly restore
 a bookmark. Treat all properties in this category as opaque values and do not make
