/**
 The render queue is responsible for scheduling and completing tasks. Typically
 you don't create your own render queue but instead use the render queue provided
 by the render manager. Creating your own render queue is possible but due to internal
 resource constraints will almost never speed up rendering but instead the queues
 try to access the same resources and then need to wait until the resource becomes
 available.

 The goal of the render queue is to keep the average time it takes to complete a
 render task at a minimum. To achive this the render queue intelligently schedules
 and bundles tasks. Therefore the order in which scheduled tasks are executed is
 undefined and depends on many factors.
