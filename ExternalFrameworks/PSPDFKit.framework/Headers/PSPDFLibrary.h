 `PSPDFLibrary` implements a sqlite-based full-text-search engine.
 You set a data source that provides the documents to be indexed by the library, and then call -updateIndex, which performs it works synchronously.
 Then, you can search for keywords within that collection. Typically, you use a `PSPDFLibraryFileSystemDataSource`.
 There can be multiple libraries, although usually one is enough for the common use case.
 Furthermore, when using multiple libraries with spotlight indexing enabled could lead to duplicates in users' spotlight results.
 See https://pspdfkit.com/guides/ios/current/features/indexed-full-text-search/ for further documentation.
