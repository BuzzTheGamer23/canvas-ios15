/**
 A render task is used to create an image from the page (or part of it) of a document.

 Depending on the `PSPDFRenderRequest` cache policy, a render task checks the cache
 before actually triggering a new rendering.

 You create a render task by passing it an instance of `PSPDFRenderRequest`. Once
 you have created a render request make sure to fully set it up before scheduling
 it in a render queue.

 A simple example of requesting an image from a page:

 ```objc
 PSPDFMutableRenderRequest *request = [[PSPDFMutableRenderRequest alloc] initWithDocument:document];
 request.pageIndex = pageIndex;
 request.imageSize = CGSizeMake(320.0f, 480.0f);

 PSPDFRenderTask *task = [[PSPDFRenderTask alloc] initWithRequest:request];
 task.priority = PSPDFRenderQueuePriorityUtility;
 task.delegate = self;

 [PSPDFKit.sharedInstance.renderManager.renderQueue scheduleTask:task];
 ```

 ```swift
 let request = PSPDFMutableRenderRequest(document: document)
 request.pageIndex = 0
 request.imageSize = CGSize(width: 320.0, height: 480.0)

 let task = PSPDFRenderTask(request: request)!
 task.priority = .utility
 task.delegate = self

 PSPDFKit.sharedInstance.renderManager.renderQueue.schedule(task)
 ```
