/**
 This class describes the save options you want to enforce when processing a
 pdf file. Using a save options object overrides the default options of a file.

 A pdf file can have multiple security-related options set. The owner password
 generally controls the editing of a document and is required as soon as you want
 to encrypt a document in any kind. The user password prevents users from viewing
 the pdf. It is optional but if you specify it you also need to specify an owner
 password.

 You can also specify the key length of the encryption. This controls how large
 the key is that is used for actually encrypting the document. The key is derived
 from the passwords you specify. As soon as you specify at least an owner password
 you also need to decide on a key length to be used. You can also specify
 `PSPDFProcessorSaveOptionsKeyLengthAutomatic` in all cases and let PSPDFKit decide
 on if and what key length to use.

 To specify what operations are allowed when opening the document with user privileges
 you can also set `PSPDFDocumentPermissions`. With user privileges you can always
 view the file in question and by specifying `PSPDFDocumentPermissions` you can
 grant further rights that otherwise would only be available when the user has
 owner privileges.

 @note In order to use this class, you need a license that enables you to use the
       Document Editor. If you want to process a file while keeping the options
       of the original file, simply use `nil` as safe option.
