/**
 The `PSPDFDocument` class represents a set of PDF sources that are displayed as one document.

 The PDF sources are internally represented as `PSPDFDataProvider` objects.
 The typical use case is to initialize the document with a single `fileURL`, which creates an implicit
 `PSPDFCoordinatedFileDataProvider` by default. You can also opt to use `NSData` or custom
 `PSPDFDataProvider`s as sources during initialization.

 This object can be created on any thread. Accessing properties is thread safe but might take some time,
 as the underlying PDF documents need to be processed to fetch data like `pageCount` or `title`.
 The document builds an internal cache, so subsequent access is faster.
 For this reason, ensure that document objects are not created/destroyed randomly for maximum efficiency.

 Ensure that a `PSPDFDocument` is only opened by one `PSPDFViewController` at any time.
 Also ensure that subclasses do not implement their own equality semantics, and instead use the `UID` property to check if two documents are equal.

 `PSPDFDocument` supports `NSFastEnumeration` by enumerating over its `documentProviders`. The document
 providers are internal wrappers around the `PSPDFDataProvider`s created during initialization.

 Keep in mind that iOS is an environment without virtual memory. Loading a large PDF will simply get your app killed by the iOS watchdog while you try to allocate more memory than is available.

 If you use `NSData` because of encryption, look into `PSPDFDataProvider` instead for a way to dynamically decrypt the needed portions of the PDF.

/**
 Page binding describes the side on which a book would have its binding. It is used
 to describe the scroll direction and page layout in various views through out the
 framework.

 A page binding of `PSPDFPageBindingRightEdge` usually is found on PDFs with right
 to left writing systems as their main content, such as Arabic, but also in vertical
 systems such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.

 If you are not familiar with the differences between right-to-left (RTL/R2L) and
 left-to-right (LTR/L2R) writing systems, imagine a stack of paper. If you want
 to create a book out of this stack, you can add a binding either on the left or
 on the right side of the stack. If the writing on the pages has a RTL reading direction
 you would usually add the binding on the right side, if it has a LTR reading direction,
 you would usually add the binding on the left. This property controls exactly this,
 as a PDF is just a stack of pages.

 The default value is read from the PDF and is set to `PSPDFPageBindingUnknown`
 if the PDF does not provide this value, which will make the UI fall back to a default
 page layout.

 You can set this property to force a specific page binding on a document.

 @note If you set this property, make sure to call `reloadData` on any `PSPDFViewController`
       currently displaying this document.
