 `PSPDFDrawView` allows drawing or erasing on top of a `PSPDFPageView`
 and handles new annotation creation.

 The class holds an array of `PSPDFDrawLayer` objects that will
 later be converted into PDF annotations.

 The conversion from draw view to annotation isn't necessary 1:1.
 Some draw actions can be left out
 (for instance if there are validation errors like too few points for the annotation).
