 A render request specifies the exact parameters of how an image should be rendered.
 You use it in order to configure a `PSPDFRenderTask` which can then be passend
 to a `PSPDFRenderQueue` in order to fulfill the task.

 To create a new render request you usually create a `PSPDFMutableRenderRequest`
 and set the properties you need.

 # Thread safety

 PSPDFRenderRequest is not thread safe, you should never modify a mutable render
 request from multiple threads nor should you modify a mutable render request while
 reading data from it on a different thread.

 As soon as you hand over ownership of a render request to the render engine, it
 is copied, so that you do not need to worry about thread safety between your render
 requests and the ones the render engine holds.
