Teachers, grading assignments just got more magical. Put away the stacks of paper and manila folders.  Canvas SpeedGraderâ„¢ lets you grab your iPad and flip through assignments with ease, whether you're at home on the couch or at the mechanic getting your oil changed.

With an all new redesign, support for iOS 8, and point comment annotations, getting timely feedback to your students has never been easier.  

SpeedGrader allows you to:
* See assignment submissions just like web Canvas
* View photo and video submissions
* Listen to audio submissions
* Create video, audio, and text comments to students
* Grade using different methods from a simple letter grade to a complex rubric
* Open documents in other native iPad apps

If you're an instructor who uses Canvas, SpeedGrader makes grading a valuable experience again.
