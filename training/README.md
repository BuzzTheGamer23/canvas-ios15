# React Native Learning Path

* [JavaScript](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/learn)
    * Primary language used in React Native
    * ES6 via [Babel 6](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/learn/) is used (will move to Babel 7 soon)
* [Swift](https://swift.org/documentation/)
    * Used to build native components
* [Objective C](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html)
    * Objective C code is being replaced by Swift
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
    * Used for state management within the React app
    * Integrated with the networking stack
    * Team is moving away from Redux because of maintenance complexities 
* [fetchPropsFor](https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ios/blob/master/rn/Teacher/src/canvas-api/fetch-props-for.md)
    * Internally developed middleware solution sitting between React and networking components
* [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
    * Used to create the apps
    * Important components
        * [StyleSheet](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/stylesheet.html) is an abstraction over CSS
        * [Flexbox](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flexbox.html) used for layout of React Native components. (this is part of StyleSheet)
        * [Format message](https://www.npmjs.com/package/format-message) used for localization
* [Flow](https://flow.org)
    * Used for type checking
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io)
    * Unit testing framework
* [Lodash](https://lodash.com)
    * Utility library

## Project Ideas

* JavaScript
  * Start by making a small app without UI (maybe use Node). e.g. Data Seeding app or a Canvas API proxy
* React Native
  * Create a small "Canvas Grades" React Native App using our newest technology stack which logs into Canvas, grabs and shows grades
    * Build small components login flow in React Native

## Other useful resources

* [RNTester](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/master/RNTester)
    * A react native sample app that showcases React Native UI components
